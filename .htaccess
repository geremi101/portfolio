## First rewrite to HTTPS:
## Don't put www. here. If it is already there it will be included, if not
## the subsequent rule will catch it.
#RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
## Now, rewrite any request to the wrong domain to use www.
## [NC] is a case-insensitive match
#RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
#RewriteRule .* https://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
